# Hi, I'm Haider Zia! ğŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate **Computer Science** student at **FAST University Islamabad** with a knack for building clean, user-friendly applications. I love solving real-world problems using technologyâ€”especially through **Java**, **C++**, and **Web Development (HTML/CSS/JS)**. Whether it's creating dynamic web apps or architecting systems in C++ with OOP principles, I'm all about continuous learning and turning ideas into solutions.
